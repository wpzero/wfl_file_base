# WflFileBase

this gem is used to map a file to a record based on the activerecord.
this gem is very simple and small. but I think it can fit most the requests of u.
this gem is similar to carrierwave. I must admit 'yes'
before I write this gem, I use the carrierwave in my project, my project has the function network disk. but the carrierwave can not bind the folder to a record(so not fit my request and the carrier is too fat).so I write a gem.
